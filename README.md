# Mello

This is a kanban board app created to expand my knowledge of Javascript and jQuery. Users can create an account, allowing them to create boards to organize and complete tasks. 

The app was built within a Ruby on Rails framework. The information is saved to a PostgreSQL database. jQuery was used for all the functionality of the app, from handling account creation, to adding boards, lists and cards. The use of Javascript and jQuery allowed for realtime DOM updates without page refreshes.
